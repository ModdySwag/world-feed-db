# ARGUS — Global Camera Intelligence

Argus is an open-source, real-time interactive map of **229,000+ public traffic and CCTV cameras** from government and commercial sources worldwide — highway DOT cameras, city traffic cams, and public webcams, aggregated from open data APIs and rendered on a GPU-accelerated map (with a 3D globe view built in). Dashboard for exploring live camera feeds, HLS video streams, and static snapshot imagery by country, region, or city, backed by a Python scraping pipeline that keeps the dataset current.

It's two independent halves:

- **Frontend** (`src/`) — a React + TypeScript dashboard. Reads a static JSON payload at runtime; it never talks to the scrapers directly.
- **Data pipeline** (`scripts/`) — a Python CLI that scrapes camera metadata from ~10 government/commercial sources into a local SQLite store, then exports it to the JSON payload the frontend reads.

> **Note:** This project already comes with all of the cameras preloaded, so there is no need to scrape unless you want the most up-to-date cameras.

## Features

- **2D map view** — thousands of camera dots over a dark MapLibre basemap, rendered with Deck.GL for performance at scale. 
- **3D globe view** — the same data on a rotating globe (`react-map-gl` + MapLibre's native globe projection), toggleable from the HUD.
- **Live feed playback** — HLS streams via `hls.js` where available, falling back to a cache-busted static JPEG poll if the stream fails. A local dev-only proxy (`scripts/server.py`) resolves CORS and `ipcamlive://` streams that a browser can't reach directly.
- **Filters, settings, and a country/sector browser** for narrowing down the camera set, plus a "jump to random camera" action.
- **In-app data sync** — a Settings-panel button that triggers a scrape and re-export via the local control server, with live progress streamed into the UI.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0` (required by Vite 8), Python 3.9+.

**Frontend**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # Vite dev server, http://localhost:5173
```

Other frontend commands:

```bash
npm run build      # tsc -b && vite build
npm run lint        # eslint .
npm run preview      # preview a production build locally
```

There is no test suite configured (`npm test` does not exist).

**Data pipeline** (from `scripts/`)

```bash
cd scripts
pip install requests
python scraper.py --list      # see all plugins
python scraper.py --all       # run everything
```

Camera data lives in a SQLite store (`scripts/data/cameras.db`) and is exported to `public/cameras.geojson` plus the three-tier payload the frontend reads at runtime: `cameras.core.json` (map), `cameras.labels.json` (names, loaded behind it), and `cameras.detail/` (one chunk fetched per camera opened).

**Local dev control server** (optional — powers the in-app "Data Sync" button)

```bash
python scripts/server.py    # listens on http://localhost:8787, run alongside `npm run dev`
```

## Configuration

Only the `windy` plugin needs a key — every other source is keyless. Create `.env` in the project root:

```env
WINDY_API_KEY=your_key_here
VITE_WINDY_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Get a free key at [api.windy.com](https://api.windy.com/). Both vars must hold the same value — `WINDY_API_KEY` is used by Python, `VITE_WINDY_API_KEY` is exposed to the browser by Vite.
